        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p id="scroll">
            My name is Liam Alexiou, I am a Game Design and Development Major.
            I like playing videogames, watching games being made, reading, 
            mountain biking, rock climbing, metalworking, listening to music, 
            joking, 3D modeling, and did I say playing videogames?<br>
            My goal for this class consists of two parts:
            <ol>
                <li>Get a good grade.</li>
                <li>Make my dream web-page.</li>
            </ol>
            Other than that, I am eager to learn the material that is to come, 
            but less eager to do the reading. <br>
            My goals for my major are to be able to put the thoughts in my 
            head into a tangible substance so I can maybe clear the space out 
            for other thoughts. The gist of it is that I like making parts of 
            games and I really enjoy that, so why not the entire thing?

            <!Maybe add more, maybe not>
            <!goals your time at RIT, and where 
            do you want to be when you graduate?>
