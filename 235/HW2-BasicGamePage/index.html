        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
        Dirty Bomb takes first person shooters back to their purest
        roots in a fast-paced team game that will challenge even the
        most competent players. This game won&rsquo;t hold your hand, in
        fact it is more likely to kick your teeth in. With no
        controller support or aim assist, all that lies between you
        and certain death is player skill and reaction. Work together
        or die alone in the most challenging team-based FPS.<br><br>A string
        of 'dirty bomb' attacks cripple London, leaving the Central
        Disaster Authority to restore it. When criminal syndicate
        Jackal begin disrupting and stealing their technology, the
        capital is thrown into chaos as mercenaries from across the
        globe are hired by both sides. <br><br>That's where you come in.
        After all, what&rsquo;s a little radiation sickness when there&rsquo;s
        money to be made?

            <p>"Acceptable, but could have been so much better.
                Dirty Bomb is hampered by free-to-play nagging, small maps,
                and too many uninspiring matches. 5/10<br> &mdash; PC
