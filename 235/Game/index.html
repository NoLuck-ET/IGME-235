    Description </h3> 
    <p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which 
    you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping 
    you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will         
    continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air 
    pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they 
    explode. [...] </p> <br> <br>

        "Games That Were Made While a Programmer Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror movies too.
